\section{Limitations and future directions}
Our computational complexity for solving bilevel programs with general convex inequalities is $O(\delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-4})$ oracle calls for reaching $(\delta,\epsilon)$-Goldstein stationarity, where we lose an $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ factor constructing the inexact gradient oracle. We believe this rate is not inherent to the problem and that a better approach could potentially improve it to the best known rate $O(\delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-3})$ for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization. Furthermore, removing the Lipschitzness assumption on $y^*(x)$ for this setting is an important direction for future research.
