## Executive summary

- We ran the comprehensive convergence test on a 100D strongly convex bilevel problem with linear constraints. Both algorithms converged in upper objective within tolerance, but their bilevel “gap” (true gradient norm) did not align:
  - F2CSA final gap ≈ 3.2561e-05
  - DSBLO final gap ≈ 3.7663e-03
- This means DSBLO’s final x is near an objective minimum but not near a stationary point of the full bilevel gradient as measured by compute_gap.
- I applied a correctness fix to DSBLO’s compute_perturbed_gradient so the implicit gradient path is preserved (same x used for LL solve and upper objective). This should improve gradient alignment in subsequent runs.

You asked for a full report so we won’t need to re-run; the key metrics, setup, and diagnostics are captured below.

## Problem setup

- Dimension: 100; Constraints: 20; Device: cpu; dtype: float64 (inferred); noise_std: 1e-4
- Condition numbers:
  - Upper eigen: λ_min≈1.972, λ_max≈2.028 → cond≈1.03
  - Lower eigen: λ_min≈1.972, λ_max≈2.029 → cond≈1.03
- Feasibility at origin: max_violation < 0 (feasible)
- Seeds: torch.manual_seed(42), np.random.seed(42)
- Initial diagnostic (reference point):
  - Gap at origin: ≈ 1.627851 (direct ≈ 1.627941, implicit ≈ 0.003767)

## Algorithm configurations

- F2CSA
  - α=0.12; α1≈69.444; α2≈4822.531; δ≈0.001728
  - N_g=109 (set by env), outer optimizer forced SGD, lr=5e-3
  - EMA decay=0.95; tau_factor=5.0; lam_beta=0.9; other gating diagnostics printed
- DSBLO
  - Momentum β=0.9; σ=1e-4; γ1=50.0; γ2=5.0
  - EMA decay reported as 0.9 in the harness
  - Adaptive stepsize (paper): η_t = 1/(γ1||m_t|| + γ2)
  - Note: The harness computed an additional cap η_t ≤ min(0.1, 0.5·gap), but the step value it printed was the uncapped η_t. This creates an important diagnostic discrepancy (see “Root cause hypothesis”).

## Run timeline highlights

- Starting state (shared x across algos):
  - Starting gap ≈ 2.530663 (direct ≈ 2.530882, implicit ≈ 0.003767)
  - Starting objective ≈ 1.599922; ||x|| ≈ 0.983468
- Early iterations (DS-BLO indicates strong descent with growing momentum)
  - Iter 0: DSBLO gap ≈ 2.501969, step (printed) ≈ 5.664e-02, ||m|| ≈ 2.531e-01
  - Iter 5: DSBLO gap ≈ 2.324615, step ≈ 1.567e-02, ||m|| ≈ 1.177e+00
  - Iter 10: DSBLO gap ≈ 2.099104, step ≈ 1.078e-02, ||m|| ≈ 1.756e+00
- Mid-course: both algorithms continue decreasing gap with DSBLO momentum rising then stabilizing; steps moderate around ~1e-2.
- Tail region (near end):
  - F2CSA gap stabilizes at ≈ 3.2561e-05 (converged).
  - DSBLO gap stabilizes at ≈ 3.7663e-03; printed step ≈ 2.000e-01 with very small ||m|| ≈ 3.9e-06.
  - F2CSA plateau diagnostics printed repeatedly; DS-BLO gap was reported alongside.

## Convergence results

- Final gaps:
  - F2CSA: 3.256128e-05
  - DSBLO: 3.766331e-03
  - Gap mean ≈ 1.899e-03; range ≈ 3.734e-03; tolerance target 1e-4 → not aligned
- Final upper objectives:
  - F2CSA: 8.008021e-05
  - DSBLO: 8.363170e-05
  - Range ≈ 3.55e-06 ≤ 1e-4 → aligned

Interpretation: same objective neighborhood, different stationarity quality (true bilevel gradient norm higher for DSBLO).

## Gradient probes and tail diagnostics

- Gradient-direction probes at matched x:
  - Early: cos(F2CSA, DSBLO) ≈ 1.0000 with both norms ≈ 2.531 → strong alignment initially
  - Late tail: cosines become unreliable since the “ref” gradient (F2CSA) norm ≈ 1.515e-11 (near zero), making direction metrics numerically unstable (cos≈0.0001 with tiny reference norm).
- DS-BLO tail diagnostics (at final x):
  - true ||∇F|| reported via problem.compute_true_bilevel_gradient (total/direct/implicit) were printed; raw/EMA/momentum norms and cosines with true total were computed. The run saved gradient_probe_summary.csv and fd_probe_summary.csv for deeper post-hoc analysis even without rerunning.

## Lower-level solver quality

- LL solver: projected_gradient_active_set_kkt
- Converged: True
- Typical KKT residuals: O(1e-17); constraint violation ~0 across the run
- Confirms LL solutions are precise and do not explain the gap discrepancy.

## Fix applied (already in codebase)

- DSBLO: compute_perturbed_gradient now uses the same x variable for the LL solve and the upper objective (no clone for the objective target), preserving the implicit autograd path ∂y*(x;q)/∂x.
- Expected effect: improved stochastic hypergradient quality and alignment in probes/tail, especially near optima.

## Root cause hypothesis for gap mismatch

- Harness stepsize treatment for DSBLO:
  - Actual update uses η_t = min( 1/(γ1||m||+γ2), min(0.1, 0.5·gap) )
  - Printed “step” uses the uncapped 1/(γ1||m||+γ2)
  - In the tail where ||m|| ≈ 4e-06, uncapped η_t ≈ 1/γ2 = 0.2, printed as 2.000e-01
  - But with gap ≈ 3.766e-03, the cap min(0.1, 0.5·gap) ≈ 1.883e-03, over 100× smaller
  - This mismatch implies DSBLO was taking much smaller actual steps than suggested by logs, plausibly stalling true gradient norm reduction near the tail despite objective alignment.
- Additional contributing factors:
  - EMA + momentum lag in the tail can under-drive updates if steps are capped.
  - Single-sample stochastic hypergradient with σ=1e-4 can create a noise floor; variance reduction (EMA) may not be sufficient with very small tail steps.

## Recommendations (no rerun required to agree on changes)

- In the harness loop for DSBLO steps, remove the extra cap and use the paper step exactly:
  - η_t = 1/(γ1||m_t|| + γ2)
  - This matches the algorithm class and eliminates the cap-induced stall.
- Optional, paper-consistent variance control:
  - Reduce σ late in training if plateau is detected (e.g., halve σ once in the tail to 5e-5, floor 1e-6).
  - Lower EMA decay to 0.9 in the tail to reduce lag.
- Then re-run to validate gap alignment with F2CSA. If you prefer, I can implement just the first change (remove harness cap) and run the check.

## Reproducibility and artifacts (so we don’t need to re-run)

- Seeds: torch=42, numpy=42
- Algorithms executed: F2CSA and DSBLO (ONLY_ALGOS env used)
- Key configurations are listed above
- Saved files:
  - comprehensive_convergence_test.png (plots)
  - comprehensive_convergence_summary.csv (final metrics)
  - gradient_probe_summary.csv (probes over time)
  - fd_probe_summary.csv (finite-difference probes)
- Representative final metrics:
  - F2CSA: gap=3.256128e-05; objective=8.008021e-05; KKT~4e-17; CV≈0
  - DSBLO: gap=3.766331e-03; objective=8.363170e-05; KKT~4e-17; CV≈0
  - Late DSBLO: ||m||≈3.9e-06; printed uncapped step≈2.000e-01; applied step likely ≈ 1.883e-03 due to cap

## What I propose next (your confirmation)

- Make a minimal edit to comprehensive_convergence_test.py to remove the DSBLO stepsize cap in the harness and rely solely on the paper η_t. No algorithm math changes, just aligning the harness with the algorithm class.
- Optionally tune late σ or EMA decay as a second step only if needed.
- Re-run F2CSA+DSBLO and report whether gaps align; I’ll include updated tail diagnostics (true vs raw/EMA/momentum) and probe cosines. 
- Workspace hygiene: after the validated run, we can keep only the final successful artifacts (png/csv) and remove older intermediates to preserve context space; kill finished terminals before starting new ones.

If you approve, I’ll implement the stepsize-cap removal (Option A only) and perform the verification run.
